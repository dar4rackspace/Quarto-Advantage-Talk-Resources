## The Datalake 

Big Query is used as the landing place for most datasources @ Rackspace in the form of `ods` (**original datasource**). Then that information is used, replicated and transformed by different **Google Projects** across the organization. 
Below is a rough sketch of the databases identified that point towards Big Query:

graph TD;

 BigQuery[(BigQuery)]

subgraph "Customer Management"
    Datasource1[(Salesforce)] 
    Datasource4[(Inhouse CMS)]
    Datasource6[(Encore)] 
end

Datasource1[(Salesforce)] --> |salesforce_ods| BigQuery;
    Datasource4[(Inhouse CMS)] --> |cms_ods| BigQuery;
    Datasource6[(Encore)] --> |encore_ticketing_ods|BigQuery;
    
subgraph "Billing"
    Datasource2[(Oracle BRM)] 
end

Datasource2[(Oracle BRM)] --> |brm_ods| BigQuery;

subgraph "IT Services"
    Datasource5[(Core)] 
    Datasource7[(VMWare)]
    Datasource8[(SCCM)] 
    Datasource9[(Microsoft365)]
end

subgraph "B.I Internal"
    Datasource10[(Jira)] 
    Datasource11[(Tableau)]
    Datasource12[(PowerBI)] 
end

 Datasource5[(Core)] --> |core_ods| BigQuery;
    Datasource7[(VMWare)] --> |double check| BigQuery;
    Datasource8[(SCCM)] --> |PENDING: system center configuration manager| BigQuery;
    Datasource10 --> |jira_ods| BigQuery


```

## The B.I Tools

For now tableau the architecture is as follows: 

A `dashboard in tableau` is a **Workbook** with a collection of 1 or more **Views**. A Workbook needs at least 1 **Datasource** to connect to. Most connections we have are with `BigQuery` but its possible to have others. 

For compliance and governability is best advise to seek to land all information in `BigQuery`, and from there connect to tableau.

```{mermaid}
graph TD;

subgraph "Tableau Environment"
subgraph "Tableau Dashboard"
    Views --> Workbooks;
end

    Workbooks --> Datasources;

subgraph "Datasources"
    BQTables;
    GoogleSheets;
    ODS;
end

    Datasources --> |BigQuery Tables| BQTables;
    Datasources --> |Google Sheets| GoogleSheets;
    Datasources --> |Operational Data Stores| ODS;

end
```
